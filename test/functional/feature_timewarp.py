"""Live-node coverage for the closing-block timestamp floor.

Once retarget windows are contiguous the block closing a period is also the block the
next window is measured from, so it may not be stamped before the block this window
started from. The arithmetic is covered by timewarp_tests; what is checked here is that
a real node rejects such a block, mines at the floor rather than below it, and applies
none of this before the activation height.

Regtest's retarget interval is 144 blocks, so height 287 closes the second period and
its floor is the timestamp of height 143.
